This plugin collection is intended for use with [Pulseaudio Parametric 
Equalizer](https://github.com/T-5dotEU/PulseaudioParametricEq) and will
be extended to support building multi-way loudspeaker crossovers in
pulseaudio.

Currently there's only one plugin implemented:
 * 3band_parameq_with_shelves (id 5541)  
   Three-Band Parametric Equalizer (Frequency, Gain, Q)  
   with low- and high shelves (Frequency, Gain, Q)
